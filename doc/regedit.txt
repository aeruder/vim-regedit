INTRODUCTION                                    *regedit*

RegEdit provides a single mapping, |regedit-<leader>E|, to help you edit
registers.  The typical use case is that you have recorded a macro and need to
tidy it up or make some changes.  With this plugin you can use
|regedit-<leader>E|, press the key for the appropriate register, and an
expression to update the register will be placed in |Cmdline-mode| for you.
When paired with |cedit| the register can even be updated in a normal VIM
editing environment via the |command-line-window|.

As a convenience a short list of special characters are replaced with
|keycodes|, to make updating the registers a little bit more clear.

MAPPINGS                                        *regedit-mappings*

                                                *regedit-<Plug>RegEdit*
                                                *regedit-<Plug>(RegEditPostfix)*
<Plug>(RegEditPostfix)       Prompts for a register and populates |Cmdline|
                             with an expression to update the register.  This is
                             the default mapping made in |regedit-<leader>E|.

                                                *regedit-<Plug>(RegEditPrefix)*
<Plug>(RegEditPrefix)        Uses standard VIM register selection for
                             indicating the register and populates |Cmdline|
                             with an expression to update the register.  If you
                             would like to use this, put something like this in
                             your configuration:
>
  nmap <leader>E <Plug>(RegEditPrefix)
<
                             After making this mapping, you could edit the 'a'
                             register by typing "a<leader>E.

                                                *regedit-<leader>E* *<leader>E*
<leader>E{a-zA-Z0-9}         Default mapping of <Plug>(RegEditPostfix).  If
                             you wanted to use a different mapping, you could
                             write something like:
>
  nmap <leader>r <Plug>(RegEditPostfix)
<

FUNCTIONS                                       *regedit-functions*

                                                *regedit-RegEdit()*
RegEdit(register)           returns expression updating the passed register.
                            If you happen to record all your macros in a
                            single register you could make a simpler mapping: >
  nnoremap <leader>Q :<C-r>=RegEdit('w')<cr>
<

                                                *regedit-RegEditRHS()*
RegEditRHS(register)        returns expression for the value of the register,
                            escaped and convenient for use in a double
                            quoted string.  If you wanted to inject another
                            register into the current register you are
                            editing, you could type
                            `<C-r>=RegEditRHS('b')<CR>` to inject it.

SETTINGS                                        *regedit-settings*

                                                *regedit-g:RegEdit_keycodes*
When RegEdit prepares a register for editing, it replaces certain common
characters with their respective |keymaps|, so instead of seeing ``, you'll
see `\<Esc>`.  The other built in mappings are for `<CR>`, `<BS>`, and
`<Tab>`.  If you find that you would like a different set of characters to be
modified you can use `g:RegEdit_keycodes`: >
  let g:RegEdit_keycodes = { "\<F1>": '\\<F1>' }
<
If you only want to add keycodes, you can copy from the default: >
  let g:RegEdit_keycodes = copy(g:RegEdit_default_keycodes)
  let g:RegEdit_keycodes["\<Up>"] = '\\<Up>'
<

If you prefer raw keycodes, set it to an empty Dictionary: >
  let g:RegEdit_keycodes = {}
<
